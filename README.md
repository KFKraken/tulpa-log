## Week 1




### Day 5

So unfortunately I have only decided to start this on the 5th day but the last few days have only been slow, but I'll give an overview of what has happened so far. 

When I first started I had a rough idea of my tulpas appearance, I haven't forced anything really I have had little passive thinks about it but nothing really. Personality, I had a few rough traits that I thought about but again nothing too set in stone.

I haven't done much active forcing, I don't know if this is a bad thing but I don't really know what to actively force about. I have however looked at a couple videos that really make me happy and give an emotional response and tried to focus it through to my tulpa. I try and just say little things to her throughout my day, things as mundane as the weather. I feel like that could be a big thing in helping development, is working on keeping your tulpa in mind at all times as much as possible. I also feel like it is my biggest problem is keeping her there even when I'm busy. I don't know. Honestly I don't really know what to do at all. I feel like there's stuff I should be doing but am not because I don't know to do them. I think I am probably gonna try go on the mentor tab on the tulpa subreddit but I don't know if that's any good. Hopefully then someone can give me a little bit of guidance.

When I have been narrating to her sometimes after a question or something somewhat emotional I feel tingles in the back of my neck, I don't know if this is anything or just me. 

One problem that I have had a little is that I have always talked to myself having full on conversations and living out random hypotheticals in my head. I feel like because of this sometimes my narrating that is basically what I do anyway just to myself is very easily distracted back to the point of focus at where I normally talk to "myself". I quote the words myself because these last few days have opened my perspective to where I realise that thing I call myself isn't really myself, because I can't be the "myself" in this situation, as it is the one talking, however the focus point is elsewhere. At a specific point in my mind, it almost feels like I can feel the spot in my brain.

Maybe that elsewhere is what we call the ego, which is why in one guide on tulpa creation I read a tulpa is compared to one's ego perhaps. I guess you can take it very far and look at in in depth, I believe  many people have, and I believe tulpas may be an interesting analogue to derive perspective on what we call and define oneself.

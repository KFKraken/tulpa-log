## Week 1




### Day 5

So unfortunately I have only decided to start this on the 5th day but the last few days have only been slow, but I'll give an overview of what has happened so far. 

When I first started I had a rough idea of my tulpas appearance, I upbeat forced anything really I have had little passive thinks about it but nothing really. Personality I had a few rough traits that I thought about but again nothing too set in stone.

I haven't done much active forcing, I don't know if this is a bad thing but I dot really know what to actively force about. I have however looked at a couple videos that really make me happy and give an emotional response and tried to focus it through to my tulpa. I try and just say little things to her throughout my day, Thursday as mundane as the weather. I feel like that could be a big thing un helping is working on keeping your tulpa in mind at all times as much as possible. I also feel like it is my biggest problem is keeping her there even when I'm busy. I don't know. Honestly I don't really know what to do at all. I feel like there's stuff I should be doing but am not because I don't know to do them. I think I am probably gonna try go on the mentor tab on the tulpa subreddit but I don't know if that's any good. Hopefully then someone can give me a little bit of guidance.
